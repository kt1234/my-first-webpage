<h1>My First Page</h1>

<p>This is my first web page, my names Katie. Im a freshman and I cant wait till im not anymore lol.</p>

<p>I run cross country for <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/">J.L. Mann</a> which is fun.</p>

<p> I love to ride horses, ive been riding since I was five which means its been ten years since I started riding. 
I first rode at Grove Station Farms, than I started IEA (Interscholastic Equestrian Association)
 it's very fun and helps me get a lot of experiance which is great.
 I really love what I do and im happy I have the oppurtunity to do it.
 I also run but I like short distance better but im doing xc any ways so it's what ever. </p>

<p>I also ride horses and I have my own named Amerigold at <a href="http://www.topcallfarm.com/">Top Call Farms.</p>
